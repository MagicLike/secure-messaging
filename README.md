# Secure Messaging Apps
Do you care about privacy? If yes you're at the right place to find a secure messenger! If not: How dare you! You should!
Underneath I listed a few.

<br>

### [Threema](https://threema.ch)
Probably one of the most secure messengers in the world

cost: 3.62 â‚¬
pros | contras
-|-
No personal information (like phone number or e-mail adress) is needed, instead you'll get a personal ID | It costs (ok, it's not that much)
The Servers are in Switzerland so your data is very protected through the very strict privacy laws there | It's not completely open source
There are regular external security audits | Some features like video calls are not as best as those from e.g Signal
